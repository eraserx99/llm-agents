# Phase 0: Research - mTLS Enhancement for MCP Servers

**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Feature**: mTLS Enhancement for MCP Servers

## Research Topics

### 1. Go TLS Implementation Best Practices

**Decision**: Use Go's standard `crypto/tls` package with `tls.Config` for both client and server
**Rationale**:
- Built-in support for mutual TLS authentication
- Mature, well-tested implementation
- No external dependencies required
- Full control over certificate validation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Third-party TLS libraries (unnecessary complexity)
- Custom TLS implementation (security risks)

### 2. Self-Signed Certificate Generation

**Decision**: Use Go's `crypto/x509` and `crypto/rsa` packages to generate certificates programmatically
**Rationale**:
- Automated certificate generation for demo/development
- Full control over certificate attributes
- No external tools dependency (openssl not required)
- Consistent across platforms

**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenSSL command-line tools (platform dependency)
- Pre-generated static certificates (not flexible)

### 3. Certificate Validation Strategy

**Decision**: Implement configurable validation modes:
- **Strict Mode**: Full certificate validation (for production)
- **Demo Mode**: Skip hostname verification, accept self-signed (for development)

**Rationale**:
- Flexibility for different deployment environments
- Security by default with opt-in relaxed validation
- Clear separation of demo vs production behavior

**Alternatives considered**:
- Always relaxed validation (poor security)
- Always strict validation (difficult for demo)

### 4. TLS Configuration Options

**Decision**: Configure TLS 1.2+ with strong cipher suites, client certificate requirement
**Rationale**:
- Modern security standards
- Mutual authentication requirement
- Performance balance

**Key TLS Settings**:
- `ClientAuth: tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert` for mutual auth
- `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` for security
- `InsecureSkipVerify: configurable` for demo mode
- Custom `VerifyPeerCertificate` function for demo validation

### 5. Certificate Storage and Management

**Decision**: File-based certificate storage in `certs/` directory
**Rationale**:
- Simple for demo/development
- Easy to inspect and manage
- No database dependency
- Standard practice for certificate storage

**File Structure**:
```
certs/
├── ca.crt          # Certificate Authority (self-signed)
├── ca.key          # CA private key
├── server.crt      # Server certificate
├── server.key      # Server private key
├── client.crt      # Client certificate
└── client.key      # Client private key
```

### 6. Integration with Existing MCP Architecture

**Decision**: Extend current `server.Server` and `client.Client` to support TLS
**Rationale**:
- Minimal disruption to existing code
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Clean separation of concerns

**Integration Points**:
- `server.Server.StartTLS()` method for TLS-enabled servers
- `client.NewTLSClient()` constructor for TLS-enabled clients
- Configuration struct for TLS settings
- Environment variables for TLS enable/disable

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Authority Management
- Self-signed CA for demo purposes
- Single CA signs both server and client certificates
- Private key protection (file permissions)

### Demo vs Production Safety
- Clear configuration flags to distinguish modes
- Warning logs when running in demo mode
- Environment variable controls for validation strictness

### Error Handling
- Specific error types for certificate validation failures
- Graceful degradation when TLS setup fails
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Performance Impact

### Expected Overhead
- TLS handshake: ~5-10ms additional latency per connection
- Encryption/decryption: ~1-2% CPU overhead
- Memory: ~10KB per connection for TLS state

### Mitigation Strategies
- Connection reuse through HTTP client pooling
- TLS session resumption
- Appropriate cipher suite selection

## Unknowns Resolved

All technical context items have been researched and decisions made. No remaining NEEDS CLARIFICATION items.

## Next Phase

Ready for Phase 1: Design & Contracts with:
- TLS configuration patterns established
- Certificate generation approach defined
- Integration strategy with existing MCP framework
- Security and performance considerations addressed
