# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent System for Temperature and DateTime Queries

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-agent-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Multi-agent system with coordinator agent that routes queries to specialized sub-agents (temperature and datetime) which connect to MCP servers for data retrieval"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need to query current temperature and datetime information for cities through natural language questions. The system should understand their intent and provide accurate, real-time information by coordinating specialized agents that can handle different types of data requests.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user asks for temperature information, **When** they query "What is the temperature in New York City right now?", **Then** the system returns the current temperature for New York City
2. **Given** a user asks for datetime information, **When** they query "What is the datetime of New York City now?", **Then** the system returns the current date and time for New York City
3. **Given** a user asks for both temperature and datetime, **When** they query "What is the datetime and temperature of New York City now?", **Then** the system returns both current temperature and datetime for New York City simultaneously
4. **Given** a user makes multiple data type requests, **When** the system processes them, **Then** the relevant sub-agents execute in parallel to minimize response time

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a city name is not recognized or misspelled? System returns an error message
- How does system handle when external data sources are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when user asks for a data type not supported by any sub-agent?
- How does system respond when one sub-agent succeeds but another fails in a combined query?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept natural language queries about temperature and datetime information for cities
- **FR-002**: System MUST correctly identify whether a query requires temperature data, datetime data, or both
- **FR-003**: System MUST route temperature-related queries to a dedicated temperature handling component
- **FR-004**: System MUST route datetime-related queries to a dedicated datetime handling component
- **FR-005**: System MUST retrieve current temperature data for requested cities from external data sources
- **FR-006**: System MUST retrieve current datetime information for requested cities from external data sources
- **FR-007**: System MUST process combined requests (temperature and datetime) in parallel when both data types are requested
- **FR-008**: System MUST return responses in natural language format that directly answers the user's question
- **FR-009**: System MUST return an error message for unrecognized or misspelled city names (no fuzzy matching required)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when city is not found or data cannot be retrieved
- **FR-011**: System MUST respond within a reasonable time for interactive use
- **FR-012**: System MUST support queries for US cities
- **FR-013**: System MUST accept city name as a command line parameter for flexibility in testing and usage

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Query**: User's natural language question containing city name and requested data type(s)
- **City**: Location entity with identifiable name for which data is requested
- **Temperature Data**: Current temperature information for a specific city including value and unit
- **DateTime Data**: Current date and time information for a specific city including timezone
- **Response**: Natural language answer containing requested information or error message
