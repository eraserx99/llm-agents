# Feature Specification: mTLS Enhancement for MCP Servers

**Feature Branch**: `002-can-you-enhance`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Can you enhance all 3 MCP servers here with mTLS? self-signed is fine as long as both client and server sides can relax the checking of the certificates for the demo purpose now."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ User wants mTLS (mutual TLS) authentication for all 3 MCP servers
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: MCP servers (weather, datetime, echo), MCP clients
   ’ Actions: establish secure communication channels with client certificate validation
   ’ Data: certificate generation, validation, secure transmission of MCP requests/responses
   ’ Constraints: self-signed certificates acceptable, certificate validation can be relaxed for demo
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No major clarifications needed - requirement is clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: secure communication between agents and MCP servers
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Certificates, TLS configuration, client/server authentication
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec is clear and implementable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
System operators and developers need secure communication between the coordinator agent and all three MCP servers (weather, datetime, echo). The current HTTP-based communication should be upgraded to use mutual TLS authentication to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity during transmission between agents and MCP servers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a coordinator agent needs weather data, **When** it connects to the weather MCP server, **Then** both client and server must authenticate each other using certificates before any data exchange occurs
2. **Given** a coordinator agent needs datetime information, **When** it connects to the datetime MCP server, **Then** the connection must be established over mTLS with successful mutual certificate validation
3. **Given** a coordinator agent needs to use echo functionality, **When** it connects to the echo MCP server, **Then** the secure mTLS connection must be established and all communication encrypted
4. **Given** an unauthorized client attempts to connect, **When** it lacks proper certificates, **Then** the MCP server must reject the connection
5. **Given** the system is running in demo mode, **When** using self-signed certificates, **Then** certificate validation should be appropriately relaxed while maintaining the authentication mechanism

### Edge Cases
- What happens when certificates expire during operation?
- How does the system handle certificate validation errors in demo mode vs production mode?
- What occurs when a client presents invalid or corrupted certificates?
- How does the system behave when TLS handshake fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST establish mTLS connections between coordinator agent and all three MCP servers (weather, datetime, echo)
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate self-signed certificates for both client and server authentication during initial setup
- **FR-003**: MCP servers MUST validate client certificates before processing any requests
- **FR-004**: MCP clients MUST validate server certificates before sending requests
- **FR-005**: System MUST support relaxed certificate validation for demo purposes while maintaining the authentication flow
- **FR-006**: System MUST encrypt all communication between clients and MCP servers using TLS
- **FR-007**: System MUST reject connections from clients that do not present valid certificates
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain existing MCP protocol functionality while adding the security layer
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide configuration options to enable/disable strict certificate validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST log certificate validation events for security monitoring

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Certificate**: Digital certificates containing public keys and identity information for both clients and servers, with attributes including validity period, signature, and subject information
- **TLS Configuration**: Security settings that define cipher suites, certificate validation rules, and connection parameters for both client and server sides
- **MCP Connection**: Secure communication channel between coordinator agent and MCP servers that maintains existing JSON-RPC protocol while adding mTLS authentication layer
