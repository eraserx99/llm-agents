# Tasks: mTLS Enhancement for MCP Servers

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-can-you-enhance/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Tech stack: Go 1.25.1, Go standard library (crypto/tls, crypto/x509)
   ✓ Structure: Single project with internal/ structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: TLSConfig, Certificate, MCPServerConfig, MCPClientConfig
   ✓ contracts/: 3 contract files → 3 contract test tasks
   ✓ research.md: Certificate generation, TLS configuration decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: certificate generation utility, TLS infrastructure
   ✓ Tests: contract tests, integration tests, mTLS connection tests
   ✓ Core: TLS configuration, certificate management, server/client extensions
   ✓ Integration: server startup with TLS, client connection with mTLS
   ✓ Polish: performance tests, security validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ✓ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (TDD critical)
- Test mTLS connections thoroughly in demo and strict modes
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing HTTP MCP servers
- Validate certificate generation works on all target platforms
- Monitor performance impact and optimize if needed

### Performance Metrics
- TLS handshake overhead: < 10ms ✅
- Request latency overhead: < 5ms ✅
- Memory increase per connection: < 10KB ✅
- All performance targets met per research.md specifications

### Known Limitations
- Self-signed certificates for demo/development only
- Demo mode uses relaxed certificate validation
- Certificate rotation not automated (manual process)
- Production deployment requires proper CA-signed certificates
